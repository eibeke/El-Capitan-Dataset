# El-Capitan-Dataset

The El Capitan corpus captures sentiment and topic information at both the review (document) and sentence levels. It is time-variant, which preserves the sentiment and topic dynamic information of the reviews.

We expect this corpus would be useful for a wide range of topic and sentiment analysis tasks such as aspect sentiment modelling, contrastive opinion mining and sentiment/topic dynamic analysis.
