    <Sentences>I must concur after being a mac fan for many years, this latest upgrade has ground my old iMac to a crawl - emails take 5 minutes to load or send, safari is much slower, itunes and photos are just painful to work with from a speed point of view.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>After the first crash on my late 2014 MacBook Pro - I shut down the computer and when I went to start up again, I got a black screen with the Apple symbol and a progress bar under it but the progress bar did nothing - so a trip to the genius bar where they helped me do a reinstall of El Capitain so all seemed well until thee days later and this time I did a restart due to not being able to connect with my Apple TV, and guess what?</Sentences>

    <Sentences>Thank you Apple for fixing the mess in Yosemite, this is a great update and is recommended to all users running Yosemite, the best thing i like is the faster animations and especially on YouTube videos when putting videos in full screen mode.. the animations are more than twice as fast and the OS is really stable and more reliable</Sentences>

    <Sentences>Thanks to Apple for making OS X El Capitan, but I simply belive there are still more things to be taken into consideration to impove the user quality; such as being able to CHNAGE THE FONT SIZE IN SETTINGS; you may even change the font size in some applications now, but then you have to go to PREFRENCES and change it for each application seperately.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>funny i Just had the battery replaced in the last two years and I&apos;m not even over 300 cycles, I took the computer to an Apple store and they told me I needed to replace the battery and logic board, I said no to the idea of spending more on the computer then it&apos;s actual worth, I went home and decided I would try downgrading so i downloaded disk maker x made a usb copy of yosimite and installed it, voila all the issues with the computer are now gone my battery is reading as being in good condition and I no longer have any graphical issues at all.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>Now I woulnd&apos;t say that these issues were all because of my laptop because I have a Macbook pro 15 inch 2013 model with 2.3 ghz intel core i7 16 GB DDR3 RAM and an Intel Iris Pro with a Nvidia GEforce GT 750 M. Switching back to OSX Yosemite fixed all the issues I had before.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>(it&apos;s not bad enough to make go to windows like some others barked, however, at the time I am writing this review, I have already made a Yosemite install Disk and am about to revert having backed up everything - which wasn&apos;t that hard considering I had kept everything on external drives to make a clean wipe of the SSD before installing EL Capitain ( you know, thinking it would make it smooth - wrong) )So afyer 1 weeks of usage, I can say that programmes: photoshop cc, lightroom cc, lightroom 5, lightroom 4, photoshop 6, steam (as well as related games).</Sentences>

    <Sentences>So anyway, I do suggest backing everything up prior to installing, give yourself the extra by formatting prior to install just to put the best luck on your side and don&apos;t get too organized because you&apos;re probably gonna revert in a week or so and you can&apos;t actually revert, you&apos;re gonna have to format it again, sorry.</Sentences>

Other than that, my only other comment is with iTunes and the latest update, 12.3.1, that re-enabled Apple Music after I explicitly disabled it; and it slapped the screen up front and centre when I re-opened iTunes *grrr* That was annoying since I have absolutely no interest in the service.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>Fact is, it became bothersome when the menu bar popped back into view while browing the web and I generally do large strides in cursor movements then get more precise in my action as I go towards the top of the screen.... As such, the menu bar almost always appeared unless I was being careful.... and I don&apos;t want to be careful doing this.... so auto-hide off.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>That was fixed a little later on with dot upgrades but I see no hickups as of yet except for one special-use case for me : - While I like the way Safari handles bookmarks, if I were to apply my favorite setup (of one line per section and folder for all the rest per category) there is excessive choppiness to the scrolling.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>It is pretty hard to find anything good about this upgrade.- Every time you do anything, the spinny beachball replaces the mouse for 30-45 seconds.- photos freezes almost every time you open it- mail crashes if it runs for more than 2 hours at a time- most apps go to &quot;not responsponding&apos; when you quit them so you have for force quit constantly- you have to reboot every 1-2 hours or the os freezes and can&apos;t recover- when I tried to sync my previosly functioning Iphone 6s, it hangs while it tries to sync photos, but the photos are synced to the iphone- every time the computer sleeps, when it wakes it can&apos;t see the thunderbolt display, and you have to disconnect and reconnect- when you connect the thunderbolt display, application windows move off the screen and the only way of getting to them is to repeatedly connect and disconnect until they re-appear on a screen- battery life has gone from 4-5 hours to 1-2 hours- 25% of the time, when the computer sleeps, it wakes up the spinny beach ball and freezes - you have to hold down the power button to get it to reboot- not sure if this is a MS problem or just another Apple screw up - MS office doesn&apos;t work.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>and very minor visual changes they actually try to call a &quot;Feature&quot; for the most part all of the new &quot;Features&quot; with the exception of split view and Metal (which wont be supported fully by devs for a WHILE) are really just stripping down our old pre existing features, giving them a paint job and calling it new and better, because.... theres less?</Sentences>

    <Sentences>Fantastic OS, downloaded on my MB air (late 2013) and iMac- Speed boost is the most noticeable, notes is on track to kill evernote and pinned/mute tabs are so needed.. We asked for alot of these updates and got them.. but its even better to get features that you didnt even know you needed.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>So I downloaded OS X El Captian and its amazing and Ill keep using it expresslly Split View but I found ont problem with Steam is when I launch a Game like Counter Strike Global Offensive it works but Steam have a feature called Steam Overlay and I found that it wasn&apos;t working so I went to the Steam Forums and saw I wasn&apos;t the only one, I know Apple can&apos;t really fix it its just Valve will have to update Steam so that it works with the new update.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>10.10 was a rocky ride but 10.11 has been buttery smooth right off the bat - no major show stopper bugs, networking is as solid as a rock not to mention the huge amount of testing and feedback that Apple has taken on board with the public betas before the big launch.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>Another little point this was my third replacement iPhone as the first 2 had faults which they replaced the handset because of which says a lot for the quality of their handsets, probably why you only get a 1 year warranty with Apple even although they claim to make the best phones in the world, Samsung don&apos;t claim this but they give you a 2 year warranty on their phones, good to see some companies are looking after their customers.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>El capitan downloaded and i went though the stages of the reboot process and updating software etc, I now have communication with the cloud again, the graphics tablets I use now work without issue, the speed has definately improved, the onboard wireless is better and seems to be stronger, the display is crystal clear and besides a slower start up time I think apple finally have a reasonable upgrade that I can say is working.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>My only gripe would be that the wireless lan does not work but I have hope that this may be addressed by apple in the next few months, the fact that the onboard wifi is working better does not make that such a huge issue anymore as I can now pull in wifi at around 30+ meters, far better than previous.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>Having read the mixed reviews I was a little sceptical and did a backup onto to a new SSD (old disk also an SSD) and swapped the drives over, once all was confirmed working, I hit the button and let the El Capitan upgrade process start, it was complete including download within 2 hours.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>As above, the new look is great and some things work better:- Great interface.- External monitor colours are much improved with standard monitor profile - previously, I had to use an xrite device to calibrate it, as the colours were way out to the point that they were distracting for web browsing, let alone working on photos.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>all backups were lost permanently though.all in all I dont like, it is slower to load up now, constantly freezes with simple tasks (please dont read this and think its the late 2011 thats causing an issue as both my HDD &amp; RAM have been upgraded and now running Solid State HDD and 8gb of DDR RAM)I must admit i like the interface and look and feel but overall not worth it, alot of fixes need to be done before hand, if i was reading this i would wait maybe a month or 2 and check to see if any updates have been released</Sentences>

    <Sentences>Users of the VoiceOver screen reader will find that navigating in some aps has become harder as the quick nav function is no longer as useful as it was, the VoiceOver keyboard command to drag and drop items between windows no longer works, it is no longer always possible to read a whole eMail in one go without opening it into a new window, and editing text boxes on web pages can be very difficult as the cursor keeps returning to the start of the text if you start to move through it one word at a time.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>I&apos;ve got a Macbook Pro 2012, it had Yosemite when I first got it and never had problem/issues when I installed El Capitan a few weeks ago, after doing a few things with safari and word, the keyboard just randomly puts symbols when I type.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>In the last 1 to 2 years it is now a daily part of my life to turn off by the power button, if not that then the programs are quitting, or generally taking forever to do anything, i always send reports to Apple, they must have a profile of all the reports that are sent into them,  i would love to see the profile of how many they get now over even 2 years ago.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>For me a thorough clean install involves 2 back ups; Creating a bootable OS installer; Wipe hard drive; Install OS from the bootable installer; and importantly, re-install data manually and start with fresh system settings so you don&apos;t carry across bugs from previous version, and also take the opportunity to not install stuff you don&apos;t use.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>Im still having to run a fan control program when running a certain program as it gets very hot, I was hoping that somewhere along the updates/upgrades etc that this would be resolved to stop the processor running so hot that the computer stops responding or hanging, it needs either Apple to introduce a low temp for when the fans kick in or the program devs solve the issue.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>Thank goodness for this OSx update .... EI Captain is running very well on both my 27&quot; iMac (2012) and recent Macbook Pro (2014 retina) I wasnt sure about the graphics to start with - a very simplistic 2D look, but its growing on me.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>I had a perfectly working 5 month old 27&quot; retina iMac running 2 admin accounts on Yosemiteafter updating to10.11.1 I had one account working fine and the other unable or unwilling to connect to icloud or complete setup.my mail app in that account just repeatedly flashed migrating on screen while the icon leapt from one end of the dock to the other.3 calls to Apple resulted in erase, download Yosemite OS through inernet recovery and knife &amp; fork data back into one account from my time machine backup.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>I updated last week without checking reviews, I must sadly say that I have lost all my data and icing on the cake was the backup time machine did not work neither, so my piece of advice, do not creat any additional headaches for yourselves and stay away from this EL CRAP upgrade, another thing that I noticed was the performance actualy is realy bad, I have now downgraded to Yosemite, will stay what I know, till Apple get their act together and become once again like the good old days of Steve Jobs with passion for their customers and not only cash in the bank!</Sentences>

    <Sentences>Having upgraded to El Capitan on a new mac mini, I find I&apos;ve lost my emails, mail boxes, on my mac folders, my printer (epson r800) won&apos;t print if the low ink light is flashing (all apple help steps don&apos;t help), I can&apos;t scroll down the screen in dialogue boxes, double clicking on a folder to open it in the finder to see the contents now opens the entire content of the folder in a launched application, I can&apos;t open a lot of my files from Snow Leopard, the &quot;save as&apos; option is now gone and the &quot;export&apos; option just isn&apos;t as good and it&apos;s a bit hit and miss if my passwords work.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>I hate this upgrade, i&apos;ve been using snow leopard for a few years and it worked great for me, the only reason i had to upgrade was because i upgraded my iPad to a iPad air and it would not connect to iTunes because it said i needed a newer version of iTunes, and since the upgrade everything runs slow and takes age to open , when it used to be pretty much instant.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>Mavericks started buggy but was pretty good at the end.i think there should be one operating system and bugs fixed constantly until the system is as stable as ever but no as soon as the OS gets remotly stable and usable theres another new OS with yet another fancy name and yes back to buggy software again&apos; just seems like after 12 month of fixing bugs another release is out and the current operating system is out dated before it becomes stable and reliable.i accept betas have bugs and i do public test them but more often than not i see the same issues after every update??</Sentences>

    <Sentences>Since updating my Mac Book Pro 2013 to El Capitan from Yosemite one cannot help but notice whats changed in the OS X platform, as i do a lot of on -line viewing instead of watching the TV I would use the built in configurable display and set this to 1.8 gamma, sadly this has now gone and can no longer be configurable, and therefore i&apos;m back to the TV as the display&apos;s contrast is not to my liking.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>iTunes update designed specifically for El Capitan will not transfer purchases from the iPhone and therefore Apps will have to be re-downloaded and then transferred to the iPhone as an update, so&apos; it&apos;s a bit more faster then, but did it need to be, Yosemite had some good traits from the previous OS X builds maintaining grass roots standards, and sadly as i don&apos;t really like it Apple have made sure that there is no way back.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>Very unstable on my system, looking to revert back to Yosemite and wait for a patched and corrected buildInstalled 10.11 at beginning of month and I have to say this is the worst Apple OS I have seen and this comes from someone that remembers OS9, constant freezes, random loss of Bluetooth keyboard/mouse, iTunes freezes, Safari freezes, App Store freezes, iTunes store purchases dont download correctly, USB blu-ray not working properly and Office 2016, well this is the worst, Outlook works for about 5 mins and then guess what - it freezes and you have to force quit.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>downloads from apple have gone perfectly this year, I downloaded iOS 9 and el capitan, usually I have to wait a day or two for downloads to cool down so I can get half decent download speeds, but this time I set it to download the second both were available and I have my upgrades quickly and smoothly.the only reason I give 4 stars is because of my last two updates (Yosemite, el capitan) I get constant Java error messages and I had to fix myself, was a quick update but still annoying enough to give 4 instead of 5 stars.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>So I would advise that you check for drivers on the website of your critical 3rd party suppliers and if OK get El Capitan - if not wait awhile, Capitan is not going away and will only improve.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>My professional sound card system that has been with me since my mobile recording days no longer works in El-Caoitan, but to be fair support for that card in OS X from the manufacturer stopped at 10.7, so I can&apos;t really complain too much in regards to that, but does mean El-Capitan will not be staying on my machine for long, and the other one will never get it.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>The update took quite a while to install (a minute lasted way longer than 60 seconds), and I haven&apos;t noticed any improvement in the machine&apos;s performance.... in fact I&apos;m seeing this new beach ball timer thing more often than I did before.</Sentences>

    <Sentences>El Capitan is considerably better, but nowhere near as intuitive or attractive as older iterations of OS X. I&apos;d rate it well below Mountain Lion or Mavericks in most respects, but if you have a contemporary Mac, this is the OS you want, not Yosemite.</Sentences>
